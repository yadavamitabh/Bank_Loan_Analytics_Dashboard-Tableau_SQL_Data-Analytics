# Bank_Loan_Analytics_Dashboard-Tableau_SQL_Data-Analytics

Designed and developed an end-to-end Bank Loan Analytics dashboard in Tableau to analyze loan performance, customer behavior, and repayment trends across multiple dimensions including loan status, verification status, purpose, grade/sub-grade, state, and issuance year.

Built interactive KPI panels to track total customers (~39.7K), total investment ($459.41M), total loan amount ($482.70M), and total payments ($373M), enabling quick executive-level visibility into portfolio health.

Analyzed home ownership vs. last payment status using tree maps to identify repayment patterns across Rent vs Mortgage customers, highlighting higher concentration of charged-off loans among specific ownership segments.

Performed grade and sub-grade–wise revolving balance analysis, identifying risk concentration across credit grades (A–G) and uncovering higher revolving balances in mid-risk grades (B–D), supporting credit risk assessment.

Built state-wise and last credit pull–wise loan status analysis, enabling drill-down into Fully Paid, Charged Off, and Current loans across top states (CA, FL, NY, TX, NJ) to support regional performance monitoring.

Developed Verified vs Non-Verified payment analysis, revealing a significant share of repayments from verified customers (~$220M vs ~$154M), helping assess the impact of verification on repayment reliability.

Created year-wise loan issuance trend analysis, highlighting rapid growth in loan disbursements post-2009 and enabling temporal analysis of portfolio expansion.

Implemented dynamic filters (Loan Status, Purpose, Issue Year) and calculated fields to allow business users to perform self-service analysis and uncover actionable insights without manual intervention.

Focused on data-driven storytelling, transforming complex banking datasets into intuitive visual insights for use cases in risk analysis, operations monitoring, and strategic decision-making.
